## Recap

25-28 May 2011

The plan for getting into Drawes' apartment was to replace a couple of the cleaners from the approved company, Skhygiene Cleaning (top flight service, guaranteed). The prepwork took a weekend to get onto the temp agency list and make sure that a vacancy was made available. Yannis and Padraig would be on the cleaning crew, to plant some bugs and snoop around. Petros was watching the front entrance with a nondescript van, and Coop had a couple of observation nests, one at the front, one at the back. The one at the front had a sniper rifle, but they decided that they probably did not need fire-power round the back.

Yannis and Padraig arrived with the cleaning crew and knuckled down to cleaning the apartment block's gym. Mike, heading up the cleaning crew, swung past a few times to check on the newbies - even with references and experience for them this was a big contract - and he did not want anything going wrong. The plan was to get some of the other cleaning crew out of the way after lunch, since one of the vacancies was from a sudden bout of food poisoning....

They managed to do this, and got assigned to a flat on the same floor as Drawes for after lunch. Coop had moved around to the back and saw that there was someone very at home within the flat. They were working on a laptop in the office and also used the kitchen. This was unexpected, since they had not seen him over the weekend or on Friday.

Eventually, with some clever coordination, Padraig managed to hop a couple of balconies and get a camera and microphone on the window to watch for a couple of days.
