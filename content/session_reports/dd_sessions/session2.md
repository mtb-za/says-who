The Dramatis Personae:

* S, playing Padraig - Irish actor, formerly linked to drug running, and then pressured by EUROPOL to act as a courier to provide gear and funds to informants and similar shady characters
* N, playing Yannis - Belgian hacker who got recruited by the ADIV/SGRS a while back. Mostly a desk jockey who acts as the 'guy in the chair'.
* An, playing Cooper 'Coop' - All-American patriot. Former Marine, pulled into the CIA as a wetworker. Easily the most trigger-happy of the group, mostly because he is the only one in the group who can _really_ shoot.
* Al, playing Petros - 'Ambiguiusly Balkan', openly works for the dog/horse racing rings that the various Balkan mafias are involved with. Is actually deep cover for the Romanian foreign intelligence agency - the SIE.

The last session ended with the agents rushing off to try and pull Olivia out of a suspected snatch-and-grab. They took just long enough to tie up the local goons that they knocked out, grabbed what they could see in terms of useful intel in the room (including an address across town that one of the goons had in a pocket, in Olivia's handwriting). They hoofed it across town, it now being late afternoon, drifting towards evening.

They quickly spotted her at a different caf√©
