## Recap

09 May 2011

After returning from Scotland, the agents took a bit of downtime to look into some of the things that they had found. They got access to one of the flight tracker archives and looked at helicopter flights around the eastern coast of Scotland. This turned out to be pretty helpful: an apparently abandoned oil rig was still getting monthly flights. The destination and origin was not the same each time. Looking at the details, they have enough information to make a guess as to the next location - although not 100% sure - and a rough date.

Padraig was also able to retroactively (while in Scotland and it being a weekday) make a call to Zarina Petran's organisation, posing as a journalist. He arranged an interview for Tuesday afternoon to speak to her. The idea would be to ask her some leading questions to see how she might react.

They also did a little digging into HGD, but it being a weekend, they were not able to get much more than the public story: it is the successor of the company that transported Dracula back to Varna in 1896. They will need to do a bit more to find out if they are still involved, and if so, how.

As Monday rolled around, they prepared to pull the trigger on getting into Dr Drawes' flat and seeing what they could find, along with recovering the camera. Yannis and Padraig went in with SkHygiene Services again. After their normal morning routine, they got the chance to get in. The big guy that they had seen last time was not around, so Padraig and Yannis took a chance to get inside and look around quickly. They found that there was noting really suspicious here: the place was well-appointed, with solid furniture. The books in general were not suspicious, although some were just for display, especially in the office. They took a look at the safe, but it was not something that they would be able to get in (Coop probably could, with a bit of time, but Yannis and Padraig are not cracksmen).

While searching, they found an old RFID card that had fallen behind the sideboard in the entrance hall. They took this and prepared to leave.

At the same time, Petros, watching the front entrance saw two men in civilian clothes with standing near each corner of the building, watching all access angles. Shortly after, he saw the big guy that had been seen in Drawes' office approaching down the street. The two watchers intercepted Drawes' man, starting a short argy bargy, ending with a couple of bleeding noses and a first aid kit being brought out from the reception area of the apartments. While everyone was focused on the front, Coop, from his overwatch position, saw two men in street clothes with backpacks get into the delivery door downstairs at the back.

Padraig and Yannis made sure to be out of Drawes' flat, Yannis at the front, Padraig back onto the balcony. They watched as the two went to the door, used a keycard to get in, and then went straight to the desk in the office. They could not see what these other intruders were doing, but they did not take very long before heading out. The session ended there.

## GM Notes and Thoughts

This was at least partially because I wanted to start upping the stakes. Introducing a new(?) player or two on the scene provided that. The infiltration went smoothly enough, since they had done it before, so I fast-forwarded that quite a bit. In terms of getting anything useful, they were a little less lucky, aside from the keycard.

But, they have some new people on the scene, which should give them some options: tailing them, capturing them, something else?
