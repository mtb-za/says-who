## Recap

06 May 2011

Being so close to the last known location of HMS Proserpine, as a shore base at Lyness, Scapa Flow, the agents decided to nose about a little. They found a small boat willing to take them across in the morning. They were able to do this while Coop travelled up from London overnight.

They checked out a few things, looking at the naval museum and speaking to some of the old locals. The Scapa Flow Museum had the basic: the shore base was shut down in 1946 when the naval base closed at the end of WW2 and HMS Proserpine is no longer on the navy roll as an official navy entity. Some of the old-timers were kids during WW2, and remembered the base. There were also a handful of stories about the oil rigs, and how they are what holds up the local economy now.

Petros decided to check out the cemetery, which has a number of war graves from accidents and various attacks during the two world wars. Despite expecting something nasty to happen, the rainy morning held no dangers.

While all of this was going on, Yannis' commodore called to tell him that he had just gotten a visit from some very scary people for asking around about HMS Proserpine. He was not going to be able to do anything more about it for Yannis.

## GM Notes and Thoughts

Definitely a dud session, I felt. Petros' player in particular seemed to want something to happen at the cemetery, but honestly I had no real reason to do so. If I was going to run the session again I think that something would need to happen up here. I had sort of expected them to do something in the area, but given that everything had long been abandoned, there was not much to really find here, without a secret base of some kind, which also did not seem reasonable.

Ah well, they can not all be winners.
