One of the central questions for starting a Dracula Dossier campaign is to decide how the agents are going to get the actual dossier. There are a couple of options given in the book, as well as some published operations that can do it. Two of those published operations are **(S)Entries** and the **Harker Intrusion**. I could not decide which, so I used both, roughly like this. **(S)Entries** is available in the Nights Black Agents core book, and **The Harker Intrusion** is one of the Edom Files adventures.

An approach for combining the two that roughly matches what I did:

1. Harker Intrusion - The Marrakesh Extraction (can do this almost anywhere in the Med, but could be fun somewhere around Greece/Turkey/Cyprus)
2. Harker Intrusion - The Gibraltar Triangulation (this is any convenient military installation that the black bag team could be based at, but with a clue pointing towards an officer from which they can undertake...)
3. (S)Entries - The Lift (this could take place at the same installation as the Gibraltar Triangulation or be a different place entirely, depending on how quickly you need things to move in your session)
4. (S)Entries - The Rendezvous (turned into an ambush - instead of meeting someone according to a previous plan, vehicles block a narrow road to try and trap the agents and force them to hand over Lennart's laptop)
5. (S)Entries - The Trail (instead of pointing to directly to Belgrade, point things towards...)
6. Harker Intrusion - The London Connection (pretty much as written, giving the agents the Dossier properly, perhaps not in London though?)

Since I did some research on it for my own game, here are some suggestions for notable NATO or UK military bases around the Mediterranean to move The Gibraltar Triangulation and The Lift to, if you decide not to use Gibraltar. If they are the same place, Lennart could be a British officer who is overseeing local Edom actions, records which are kept on the laptop and explains why the apparent security breach in not keeping a backup and in leaving the base with it:

* Lisbon, Portugal - Allied Joint Forces Command
* Oeiras, Portugal - Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO
* Naples, Italy - Allied Joint Forces Command and NATO Naval Command
* Crete Naval Base, Souda, Greece - one of few the harbours in the world able to handle nuclear aircraft carriers, also home to significant US presence
* Izmir, Turkey - NATO Land Command
* RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus - UK RAF Base
* Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovinia - NATO HQ
* Skopje, (North) Macedonia - NATO HQ

Note that not all of these are strictly what the imagination has as a 'military base', being largely organisational and logistics. They will still have at least a few troops around, so one can not just walk onto the base with no prior planning.

Of course, the London Connection could be anywhere that seems interesting, but the Dracula Dossier has a fair number of people and places in the UK, so starting there might be a sensible idea, unless you want to start unravelling Edom/Dracula's conspiracy from a different direction, which is, of course valid. The overall structure will still work, and you might be able to change whom Hopkins is based on location if you wanted to be on the more avant garde side of things.

This blending is of course not needed: you could run either of these adventures perfectly well. This is for if you want to do something different, I guess.
