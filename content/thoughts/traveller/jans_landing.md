This is an entry for the SFRPG Secret Santa. Doubloon asked for a space truck stop, and well, here it is. Welcome to **Jan's Landing**:

## Summary

Jan's Landing is an old, rundown asteroid base built and used by Mzansi Minerals during the mining boom in the near belt a few decades ago. When Mzansi finally pulled out 13 years ago the manager, Jan Huysamen, took over the site for pennies on the dollar and repurposed it as a supply hub, since it was on one of the main routes inwards from the outer system. It now serves as a relatively busy stop-over point and transit hub for in-system traffic. Rumours of the abandoned mine shafts being used to hide dissidents and smugglers are vehemently denied. It is a comfortable stop and a good place to meet those in the employ of other companies, as well as get some relaxation in between trips between the inner and outer system.

## Map

The accompanying map is a rough overview of the general layout of Jan's Landing. Numerous smaller corridors exist and many of the main ones shown have connections to the old mineworks. The plan also suggests a much smoother and flatter layout than in reality: sloped corridors and stairs are common to handle the shape of the asteroid Jan's Landing is built into. The accommodation blocks in particular are generally stacked vertically, with each one shown being double-stacked.

## Area Descriptions

### Landing Area and Warehousing

Larger vessels, especially bulk freighters, need to stand off and use a shuttle (available at a nominal fee, especially for regular and returning visitors) to get to the base. 
21 of the 24 landing bays are 'owned' by various companies in the system under long-term leases, while the remaining three are available to whomever pays for them at a daily rate. The landing bays have a rectractable roof, but are usually not repressurised to save valuable resources. An air-filled umbilical tunnel is usually hooked up to the ship and most cargo will be moved under vacuum. These are used by smaller vessels and landing in them is relatively easy for a trained pilot.

Two landing bays are connected to a shared warehouse area under pressure, usually cluttered with boxes and containers. These warehouses are filled with various supplies and other shipments to smaller outposts in the outer system. The warehouses are airlocked from the facility, and need passcodes and similar authentication to access. The lack of strict schedules means that cargoes are often left at Jan's Landing for longer than companies would like. Despite everyone's efforts, there is still some shrinkage.

Landing ships need to clear themselves with traffic control in order to be allowed to land in a bay. Overflow is handled either with ships standing off and paying for shuttles or landing outside the demarcated bays. The latter provides minimal services although normally a power cable can be supplied. Access to and from the ship will then require vacc suits and a short space walk.

### Living Quarters

These are extremely rough and ready, being converted from the mining barracks. They have reliable life support systems and have been made at least a little nicer to spend time in. Again, companies are able to hire sections of the accommodation blocks are relatively low prices for extended time. Since the Mzansi was relying largely on semi-automated mining methods, there is space for approximately 250 visitors at a time, but occupation is normally lower. Again, for overflow, crew can stay in their own vessels, hooking into the life support systems of the station for a small fee. The station's full life support system is capable of handling far more than 250 people, especially as regards air purification, since it was intended to handle mining debris.

The general arrangement of the barracks are units of 12 in doubled quarters (so six rooms that are more spacious than on most vessels) surrounding a shared living, kitchen and ablution area. These are generally access-controlled, but not strictly so. Each eight of these units is connected to a shared common room, for a semi-contained block of 48 beds.

The 'permanent' staff of about 60 individuals have slightly more comfortable arrangements near the administration block, but similarly arranged. Most are here on a contract basis, normally in five-year stretches. Managers have generally been here for longer, and most of the employees are former Mzansi Mining staff.

### Recreation

There are numerous common rooms in the accommodation blocks, with view screens, comfortable seating, and some gaming tables. A larger area that used to be used for housing mining machinery has been converted to an exercise area: being able to actually move and not run on the spot is a novelty. This gym area is also host to occasional prize fights and similar events, usually between representatives of the companies. It can also be used for larger meetings and similar public events such as film showings.

### Administration

The original offices from Mzansi are still in use as the administration centre for the complex. This houses the main traffic control centre, facilities management, life support systems, security office, and main control room.

### The Underside

Being built on a former mine, asteroid is riddled with tunnels and shafts. These have been mostly sealed off, but many can still be reached. Most open entrances need a spacewalk to get to, but there are a few that are not as sealed as they appear. Officially, there is no working life support outside the main base, but rumours abound of accessible tunnels being used for smuggling, of both valuables and people, the latter needing life support. There are intermittent inspections from the Trade and Mining Consortium, but nothing has been officially found.

## Operations Overview

Most everything is run from the administration building. Most things are staffed around the clock, with approximately 20 staff on duty for any shift of the three standard shifts. The major exception is facilities management, who run one large team and two short teams. When not on shift, some workers get some extra scrip as stevedores and similar shore-side cargo handlers on a temporary basis if ships need them, but this is voluntary - ships are normally expected to handle it themselves.

Life support has numerous smaller areas that need regular checking and maintenance, and security personnel do occasional checks of possible trouble spots or respond to guest emergencies, but most people are in the main administration building for their whole shift. Facilities management includes a janitorial staff with dispersed duties, but many basic functions such as floor cleaning are automated. They are also resonsible for life support systems, but that is a specialised team, in most instances.

## Notable People

### Jan Huysamen

The CEO and the 'Jan' in "Jan's Landing". Large, loud man with the tell-tale bruised face of someone who has undergone more than one decompression event. Upfront, honest-faced, wants to make sure that his customers get what they need to come back again in the future. Was the manager when Mzansi pulled out and negotiated to take over when they left. Having run the supply base for a while, Jan knows a legion of important people. Runs a tight ship and does not mess around when it comes to safety. The quickest way for anyone off the station is to do anything to compromise that. While trying to make things a success, is unwilling to try too many new things, usually on grounds of safety concerns.

### Miriam Buthelezi

Operations manager and Jan's second-in-command. Cheerful, efficient, notable laughter lines. As operations manager, she is responsible for much of the day-to-day operations that keep Jan's Landing running smoothly while Jan handles the big picture and negotiates with the Companies. Usually a good source for all sorts of information about the system, since people like talking to her. Somewhat frustrated that more is not being done to have actual entertainment on the station, but is mostly focused on making sure that visitors can load and unload cargo smoothly and that they have a good stay.

### Gillette Masinga

Small, wiry second-in-command. Comfortable in that role, but would love to get some of his own ideas for facilities and projects for Jan's Landing taken more seriously. Capable, but feels overshadowed by Jan. The obvious choice as CEO should Jan step down or no longer be capable of running.

### Penelope Mantashe

Tough, no-nonsense head of security. She has been here as long as Jan (she was deputy security chief for Mzansi Minerals), and is loyal to him. Her personnel are fairly well-equipped, but the lack of practical experience makes them a little unreliable in a pinch. Constantly on-edge and expecting something to go wrong, verging on paranoia. Rumoured to send security sweeps into the mineworks, but if these are happening, nothing has been said about what was found.

### Markram Ndlela

Facilities manager. Greying, tall and thin. Has numerous ideas for possible additional ways to make money by having more interesting events and special offers, which would also include hiring more staff as entertainers of various kinds. So far most of these ideas have been shot down by Jan, although Miriam is willing to support him for some of the less outlandish ideas. Facilities management includes life support systems, and the barely whispered rumour is that between him and Eduard du Toit, head of Life Support Systems, they can find you almost anything that you could want.

### Eduard du Toit

Head of life support systems, skinny, short, has significant decompression bruising. Quietly rumoured to be providing off-books life support to the abandoned mine, but this has never been proved. Sides fully with Jan that anything that affects safety is an absolute no-go. This causes some clashes with Markram, who feels that some of the saftey concerns are hang-overs from when this was a mine, not a bustling rest stop.
