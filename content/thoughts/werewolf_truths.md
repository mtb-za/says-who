Those beasts are truly the souls of such who are afflicted. At night, the soul leaves and roams the area. Normally this is of no account, the soul having no substance and having no shape. But on nights when the Sister is full and bright, these afflicted souls become stronger and more malevolent. They take a form that resembles that of an animal, vicious and slavering for the blood of the living. Once the Sister begins her rest, becoming darker and less full, the souls become substanceless again.

In order to remove such an affliction, silver is most efficaceous. While many believe that silver weapons will kill a werewolf, this is mistaken. Striking an afflicted soul with silver merely sends the soul back to its body for a period. In order to prevent the soul from wandering, it must be anchored to the body. The most efficaceous way to do this is to surround the seat of the soul with a circle of silver. [Note: this could explain the prevalence of silver belts found in the ruins, since the stomach is the seat of the soul.] Care must be taken to do this before the soul begins wandering or it will be unable to return.
